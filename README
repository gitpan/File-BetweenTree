File-BetweenTree version 1.02
=============================

NAME

File::BetweenTree.pm - binary search of variable length.


SYNOPSIS

        use File::BetweenTree;

        # Object interface
        $bt = File::BetweenTree->new("log_file") or
                        die "Can't open file: $!";

        # .. Gets between a and b
        $result_array_ref = $bt->search($a, $b);

        # .. or only a
        $result_array_ref = $bt->search($a);

        # .. process monitor
        print $bt->mon;


DESCRIPTION

        This module tracks the data instantly from "Sorted file of variable length" 
        with a binary search. It is simple to use,
        memory efficient and search instantly from the files of 100 million.

        You can choose to search in ascending or descending order.Further Can set 
        the offset and the number of results.
        you can set the input record separator string on a per file basis.


OBJECT INTERFACE
 
        These are the methods in C<File::BetweenTree>' object interface:

new($file, [ $rec_sep ]);

        C<new> takes as arguments a filename, an optional record separator.
        set the default record separator according to this OS.


search

        C<search> is able to find all of the intermediate element "two elements".

                search(
                $a, $b, [mode], [limit], [offset], [order_by], [col_sep], [col_num]
                );

        look for the data between <$a> and <$b>.
        <$a>, the maximum and minimum values are <$b>.
        It can be the same value <$b> a <$a>.

        The return value is an array reference. If you can not find a match, 
        it returns a NULL data. Nearby value is returned to the second. Become 
        undef if the minimum value of the one front does not exist.

                @{$result_array_ref}[0] => NULL
                @{$result_array_ref}[1] => ..Minimum value near

        C<mode> is optional; the default is '0'
        Search target set number or a text string. Settings are required to 
        appropriate an accurate result.

        [mode]
        0 : number string search dedicated
        1 : text string search dedicated.

        C<limit> is optional; the default is '1000'

        [limit]
        You can use C<limit> to restrict the scope of the C<search>.

        C<offset> is optional; the default is '0'

        [offset]
        This specifies the offset of the first row to return

        C<order_by> is optional; the default is 'ASC'
        Select a search in ascending or descending order

        [order_by]
        ASC  : ascending
        DESC : descending

        C<col_sep> is optional; the default is ','
        You can specify a separator to divide the line.

        [col_sep]
        example: value_0:value_1:value_2 => ":"

        C<col_num> is optional; the default is '0'
        Order of the sequence obtained by dividing the line.

        [col_num]
        example: value_0,value_1,value2 => Value_1 and is "1"


For example:

        foo.txt
        -------
        0:apple
        1:apple
        2:apple
        3:blackberry
        4:blackberry
        5:lemon
        6:lemon
        7:lemon
        8:orange
        9:orange
        0:pine

        my $result_array_ref = $bt->search(
           'lemon', # mininum data
           'orang', # maximum data
           1,       # mode is text string
           10,      # result 10 limit
           0,       # offset 0
           'ASC',   # order_by: ascending
           ':',     # separator to divide the line
           1,       # data of the second from the left
           );
        print "result = " . join("\n", @{$result_array_ref});

        result = 5:lemon 6:lemon 7:lemon 8:orange 9:orange


mon

        You can monitor the state of the processing

        print $bt->mon;

        Process:
